LOADNOISILY is TRUE.  "to %p\nend\n\n" is what EDIT puts in the
temporary file if you ask to edit a procedure that isn't already defined.

For documentation, there are two kinds: this manual and the help files.
The latter are generated automatically from this manual if you have a
Unix system, so in that case you need only translate this manual,
maintaining the format.  (The automatic helpfile generator notices
things like capital letters, tabs, hyphens, and equal signs at the
beginnings of lines.)  The program makefile.c may require modification
because a few of the primitive names are special cases (e.g., LOG10 is
the only name with digits included).

If you don't have Unix tools, you can just translate each helpfile
individually.  A period in a primitive name is represented as a D in
the filename; there are no files for question marks because the HELP
command looks for the file named after the corresponding primitive
that ends in P.
