ucblogo (4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * upgrade to the latest upstream version.
  * term.c: Fixed a curses bug (#10103).
  * makefile.in: Omit the version 3.3-1 patch to makefile.in.
  * rules: Use CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall -g" in build step.
  * rules: Fix package name p = ucblogo (not logo) which fixes (#6126).
  * rules: Change s/logo/\$(p)/ where appropriate.  This moves the LIBLOC to
    /usr/lib/ucblogo where it belongs.
  * rules: Added usermanual to /usr/doc/ucblogo.
  * rules: Removed redundant install -d debian/tmp/usr/lib/logo.
  * rules: Use "$(MAKE) -i clean || $(MAKE) -i -f makefile.in clean"
    instead of explicitly rm'ing files.
  * rules: Add "-rm -f makefile config.h config.cache config.log config.status
    core logo makehelp" to the clean rule to remove the results of ./configure,
    debian/rules build, and coredumps.
  * rules: Add debian/substvars to one of the rm lines and simplify it.
  * rules: Add rm -rf helpfiles since they are built dynamically.
  * rules: Install logo as ucblogo and make logo a symbolic link to it.  Ditto
    with the man page.
  * rules: don't include a copy of the README as the copyright.  Instead include
    the README as /usr/doc/ucblogo/README.gz and use the Debian standard GNU GPL
    stub copyright (appropriately modified, of course).
  * control: Use Section: devel to agree with the Debian ftp archive
    (probably should be in interpreters??).
  * control: Fix mispelling of "Berkeley implementation".
  * control: Reworked the description to be more accurate and useful.
  * ucblogo.1: Made a reasonable man page!
